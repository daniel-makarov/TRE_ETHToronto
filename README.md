# PropShare Invest - ETHToronto Submission

## Overview

PropShare Invest is an application that allows anyone to buy and sell real estate for as little as $1. This project is a part of my submission for the ETHToronto hackathon.

Utilizing the Solidity smart contract language, I've developed a contract that facilitates the creation, transfer, and management of real estate tokens on the XDC blockchain.

## Features

1. __Token Creation__: Users can create their real estate tokens with specific properties.
2. __Real Estate Properties__: Each token can be associated with a unique real estate property, including details such as description and value in tokens.
3. __Transfers and Approvals__: The contract includes standard functionalities for transferring tokens, approving allowances, and more.
4. __Automated Token Symbol Generation__: The token symbol will be auto-generated from your address.
5. __Compatibility__: This contract follows common Ethereum token standards.
## Smart Contract Details

The contract is written in Solidity and has functions to manage real estate properties, including:

- '__addProperty__': Adds a property with details like description and value.
- '__transfer__', '__approve__', '__transferFrom__': Facilitate token transfers and approvals.
- Getters for property details, total supply, balances, and allowances.

## Conclusion

RealEstateToken is a unique approach to bridging the gap between real estate and blockchain technology, allowing for seamless property tokenization, while allowing anyone to buy real estate. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or provide feedback. Your participation and interest are highly appreciated!

Thank you for going through my project! ðŸš€
